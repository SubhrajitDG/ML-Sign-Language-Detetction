# ML-Sign-Language-Detetction
An AI/ML-powered sign language detection and translation system developed as part of my MCA final year project. The system utilizes computer vision techniques (CV2) and machine learning algorithms to learn and recognize sign language gestures, enabling communication between individuals who use sign language and those who don't.
